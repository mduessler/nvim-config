# My nvim config

This is my nvim config which uses lazy as plugin manager.

## Goals

1. Development and implementation of a nvim configuration to provide an
   integrated development environment (IDE) for software projects.
2. Developing my own UI for Neovim, implemented in Lua, to extend the
   IDE functionality and improve the user experience.

## Installation

To install, just execute the `./install`. At the current state only an
automatic Installation for fedora is implemented.

## Notes & Feedback ðŸŽ‰

Enjoy using the config and thank you for using it ðŸ˜Š

If you notice any errors or inconsistencies, please open an issue â€“ feedback
is always welcome ðŸ™ƒ
