# My nvim config

This is my nvim config which uses lazy as plugin manager. This config was
developed with NVIM v0.11.4.

## Goals

1. Development and implementation of a nvim configuration to provide an
   integrated development environment (IDE) for software projects.
1. Developing my own UI for Neovim, implemented in Lua, to extend the
   IDE functionality and improve the user experience.

## Dependencies

- Nvim v0.11.4 or higher

## Installation

To install, just execute the `./install`. At the current state only an
automatic Installation for fedora is implemented.
