# My NVIM config

This is my NVIM config which uses lazy as plugin manager. This config was
developed with NVIM v0.11.4.

## Goals

1. Development and implementation of a NVIM configuration to provide an
   integrated development environment (IDE) for software projects.
1. Developing my own UI for NVIM, implemented in Lua, to extend the
   IDE functionality and improve the user experience.

## Dependencies

- NVIM v0.11.4 or higher

## Installation

To install, simply run the command `./install`.

Currently, only an automatic installation for Fedora and Ubuntu is implemented.
The installation script has been tested on Fedora 42 and Ubuntu 24.04. The
installation should also work on distributions with the same package manager.

## Notes & Feedback ðŸŽ‰
